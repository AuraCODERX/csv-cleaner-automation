# NASA APOD Fetcher (Async Version)

This is an asynchronous Python tool to fetch Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from NASA's official API using `httpx` and `asyncio`. It's designed for efficient, fast, and secure data fetching â€” especially suitable for high-performance applications or APIs with rate limits.

## Features

- **Async API Requests**: Uses `httpx` and `asyncio` to make non-blocking HTTP requests.
- **Secure API Key Handling**: Reads API keys securely from `.env` files using `python-dotenv`.
